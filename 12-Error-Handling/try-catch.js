/* An object that is created to repreent a problem that occurs.

Occur often with user input or establishing a connection.

try{} = Encloses code that might potentially cause an error

catch{} = Catch and handle any thrown Erros from try{}

finally{} = (optional) Always executes. Used mostly for clean up ex. Close files, close connections, release resources.

try {
	console.log(x);
} catch(error) {
	//console.log(error); I wouldnt recommend using .log rather I would use console.error
	console.error(error); //This will highlight any errors that occur and still handle them, its good for debugging we can clearly see the reference error 
} finally { //Close files, connections or releasing resources
	console.log("This always executes");
}

console.log("You have reached the ened!");
